        "description": "The purpose of this project was to build a system that allows user to control the Arlo mobile robot using static hand gestures, with use of camera. The project consists of three parts, the first was to develop script in Python that supposed to recognize the gestures controlling the robot. For this purpose I used convolutional neural network (pytorch library), which had to be properly trained. The next step was to create a robot program in C++ language that had to properly react to application commands. The last step was to handle communication between programs, Bluetooth 4.0 Low Energy standard was used for this purpose. Unfortunately, during the final control test Bluetooth module has been damaged, in this case I decided to use simple serial communication instead. The main assumptions of the project were to achieve real-time processing system and achieve high accuracy of hand gesture recognition. More informations on my github site",

SharpsenBox contains launcher (called SharpsenBox) and patcher, so during your game development you can create new game patches and releases them using this system, launcher will update games automatically. SharpsenBox is also self-updating when new version is released it will automatically update at aplication startup. Main problems are solved such as version checking, reading your game website, system is flexible and custumizable, you can write your own 'game page' which presents your game. SharpsenBox is written in qt-qml/c++ so program is multiplatform. Every computation is processed on client side so there is no need for any servers. Becouse of that releasing process is bit complitated I've posted  on youtube a video that describes all steps needed to publish game from beggining to the end, more details and links on my github site. Video presents Launcher used to publish my game called 'Sylio'",

For exmple you can write macro that copies some text, moves mouse coursor on top of the screen and pastes it there. Macros can have simple controll flow instructions (if, while), arithmetic (+,-,/,*) and variables. Due to simplicity you can create macros very quickly. You can assign a keyboard shortcut to the macro, and when you switch program to listening state, MacroFlow will wait for you to trigger the macro with the right hotkey, when macro is triggered again while is under execution, script is terminated. The number of macros the program can listen to is unlimited. Program is written in java with javafx gui library",

Backend is multithread server, each thread represend game lobby and handles things like game states, executing commands, exchanging data between players, checking if players are still connected etc. Each lobby has it own thread which handles unicode game chat. Server is simply secured, you need to send specific code to get access. To run server program i used Amazon AWS it provides free cloud computing, within you can set up small windows server. Currently there is only one deck available \"Talia Rocka PL\"",
